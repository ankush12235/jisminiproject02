    <h3><p> An  electronic device that emits a loud noise or other alert when someone attempts to gain unauthorized entry to a building or other premises.<p><br><p>A Burglar alarm is a system designed to detect intrusion – unauthorized entry – into a building or other area such as a home or school. Security alarms are used in residential, commercial, industrial, and military properties for protection against burglary (theft) or property damage, as well as personal protection against intruders. Security alarms in residential areas show a correlation with decreased theft. Car alarms likewise help protect vehicles and their contents. Prisons also use security systems for control of inmates.<p><br><p>Some alarm systems serve a single purpose of burglary protection; combination systems provide both fire and intrusion protection. Intrusion alarm systems may also be combined with closed-circuit television surveillance (CCTV) systems to automatically record the activities of intruders, and may interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors. Systems range from small, self-contained noisemakers, to complicated, multirally systems with computer monitoring and control. It may even include two-way voice which allows communication between the panel and Monitoring station.<p></br></h3>

    <li><h2><u>Motion sensors:</u></h2></li>

	    <h3>Motion sensors are an essential part of any home security system. They have a wide variety of uses: turning on indoor and outdoor lights, activating cameras, setting off alarms, and more. For this reason, they are often incorporated into other home alarm system equipment.</h3>
	<li><h2><u>Glass break detector:</h2></li></u>

    <h3><p>Glass break detectors are handy sensors that detect the frequency the sound of shattering glass makes and set off an alarm. These are useful to let you know if someone attempts to enter your home by breaking the windows or glass doors, making them an essential alarm system component. Typically, these small sensors are placed indoors near windows or other glass you’re concerned about someone breaking. They tend to be inexpensive, so they make great, simple investments to boost security.<p></h3>
    <li><u><h2>Door and Window sensor:</h2></u></li>

	</p>
	<h3><p>Door and window sensors detect when the door or window they are attached to opens. These devices use two sensors: one on the door or window, and one on the frame. When the door is closed, the two sensors form a closed circuit. When the door is opened, the circuit breaks, triggering a burglar alarm or text alert. This is an older technology, but it’s one that works. And like glass break detectors, they tend to be inexpensive, making great first investments in home security.</p>

    <li><u><h2>Passive Infrared sensor:</h2></li></u>

    <h3><p>A passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. They are most often used in PIR-based motion detectors. PIR sensors are commonly used in security alarms and automatic lighting applications.</p><br><p>PIR sensors detect general movement, but do not give information on who or what moved. For that purpose, an imaging IR sensor is required</p><br><p>PIR sensors are commonly called simply "PIR", or sometimes "PID", for "passive infrared detector". The term passive refers to the fact that PIR devices do not radiate energy for detection purposes. They work entirely by detecting infrared radiation (radiant heat) emitted by or reflected from objects.</p></h3>

        <h2><u>PIR sensor's working principle:</u></h2>
		<h3><p>The PIR sensors are more complicated thanthe other sensors as they consists of two slots. These slots are made of a special material which is sensitive to IR. The Fresnel lens is used to see that the two slots of the PIR can see out past some distance. When the sensor is inactive, then the two slots sense the same amount of IR.The ambient amount radiates from the outdoors, walls or room,etc.</p><br><p> When a human body or any animal passes by, then it intercepts the first slot of the PIR sensor. This causes a positive differential change between the two bisects.When a human body leaves the sensing area,the sensor generates a negative differential change between the two bisects. The infrared sensor itself is housed in a hermetically sealed metal to improve humidity/temperature/noise/immunity. There is a window which is made of typically coated silicon material to protect the sensing element.</p></h3>
		<h2><u>A motion detection circuit using PIR sensor:</u></h2>
		<h3> <p>In the above segment, we have learned the pin outs of a PIR sensor, now let’s move on to study a simple application of the PIR sensor. The below diagram depicts a motion detector PIR sensor circuit. In the presence of a human IR energy or radiation, the infrared sensor detects the energy and immediately converts it into minute electrical pulses, enough to activate the transistor BC547 into conduction and to make its</p><br><p>As a comparator, the IC741 is set up –which consists of 8 pins. Wherein the pin3 is allocated as the reference input, while the Pin2 as the sensing input. When the collector terminal of the transistor goes low, then the potential pin2 of the IC becomes lower than the potential pin3. Immediately it makes the output of the IC high, triggering the relay driver consisting of another transistor and relay. The relay triggers and switches on the alarm device, which is connected to the circuit.</p><br><p>The capacitor 100uF/25V makes sure that the relay remains on even after the passive infrared sensor is turned off possibly due the exit of the radiation source. The PIR sensor device must be properly enclosed in a Fresnel lens cover to ensure that its efficiency is sufficiently enhanced.</p></h3>

		<h2><u>Burglar Alarm working principal:</u></h2>
		<h3><p>The work of the home security system begins with the sensors and motion detectors. These devices are installed in different places that they monitor in their own ways. However, they send emergency signals to the control panel once they detect something that surpasses their tolerance level.</p><br><p>The control panel of the system works like the brain and decide the next step of action. Basically, there are two different things that the control panel performs. It can set off an alarm located near the house to alert the homeowner and the neighbors.</p><br><p>However, if the system is monitored from a centralized station, the control panel will send signals there without setting off any audible alarm. In the basic models, the control panel uses the standard telephone line to send the security message. However, some of the latest models do use the GSM and internet to dispatch signals. So, they don't need any wires.</p><br><p>The keyboard provided with the home security system enables the users to arm, disarm and program the security system according to their wish. Most of the time, users are given multiple keyboards so that they don't have to rush from one place to another to find the keyboard in emergency.</p></h3>
        <h2><u>Sensors of the Burglar Alarm:</u></h2>
		<h3>There are different types of sensors used in the burglar alarm system. Some of them are used outdoors while others are suitable for indoors.</h3>
		<h2><u>Indoor sensors:</u></h2>
		<h3>PIR: The Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors are very commonly found in most burglar alarm systems. It is passive in the sense that it captures the heat emitted from the objects. Therefore, it needs a clear sight of vision. As human body emits more heat, the sensor can detect the presence of intruders.</h3>
		<li><u><h2>Ultrasonic detector:</h2></li></u>
		<h3>These sensors send ultrasonic sound waves and receive them as they bounce back from the fixed objects in the room. So, if any object moves the wave length changes and the sensor detects moving object.</h3>
	    <li><u><h2>Microwave detectors:</h2></li></u>
		<h3>This type of sensor emits microwaves and detects discrepancies in the signals through the receiver.</h3>
		<li><u><h2>Photoelectric beam systems:</h2></li></u>
		<h3>These sensors also emit infrared light beams. However, they observe whether there is any obstruction in its way.</h3>
		<h2><u>Outdoor sensors:</u></h2>
		<li><u><h2>Vibration sensors:</h2></li></u>
		<h3>These sensors are mounted on walls or other structures. They detect any vibration that occurs when that structure is attacked</h3>
		<li><u><h2>Passsive magnetic field detection:<h2></li></u>
		<h3>These sensors can be buried and it monitors the area with the help of electro-magnetic field.</h3>
		<li><u><h2>E-field:</h2></li></u>
		<h3>These sensors too, work in a similar fashion; however they are more programmable and can provide vigilance up to 4 meters of height.</h3>
